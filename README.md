# Microapp Base Seed
This is the microapp seed, which uses [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/) on the back-end, and [ES6/ES2015](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](http://webpack.js.org/) on the front-end.

### What's a microapp?
A microapp is designed to be loaded into the main content area of the [App Hub](https://github.build.ge.com/hubs/ui-app-hub). The App Hub includes the microapp's `index.html` directly into the content section in its template, and proxies any further resource requests directly to the microapp itself.
